🌱 Soil Health Monitoring App:
This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to classify soil types from images using a trained Keras model. The app then provides detailed insights on nutrient deficiencies, recommended fertilizers, suitable crops, and soil improvement tips based on the predicted soil type. It also offers a soil distribution map and the ability to generate a downloadable PDF report.

🚀 Features:
🔍 Soil Type Detection using a trained deep learning model (Keras .h5).
